.SH NAME
amigadepacker \- Tool for depacking some compressed Amiga formats

.SH SYNTAX
.B amigadepacker
[\fB-c\fR] [\fB-h\fR] [\fB-o outfile\fR] [\fB-p\fR] [\fB-v\fR] FILE ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I amigadepacker
depacks compressed Amiga formats. PowerPacker, XPK SQSH, MMCMP
and StoneCracker 4.04 (S404) formats are supported.
Amigadepacker will automatically determine the compressed format by content.
Among other things, the tool is useful for playing packed Amiga music formats
with
.B uade
(1).

If no files are given for the amigadepacker, the data is read from stdin.
If some files are given, it tries to unpack them inplace,
i.e. overwriting the given files with unpacked data. If a single file
and "-c" is given, unpacked data is written to stdout. If a single file
and "-o outfile" is given, unpacked data is written to file named "out".

The tool can also be used to decrypt powerpacker encrypted files. That
operation will take a few hours.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c
Unpack to stdout (when regular files have been given as parameters)
.TP
.B \-h

.TP
.B \-o outfile, \-\-output\-file outfile
Write decrunched data into outfile instead of overwriting the packed
file
.TP
.B \-p
Pretend to unpack, but do not. Prints names of packed files to stderr. Pretend
mode always returns success if arguments are valid. This is useful for
searching packed files.
